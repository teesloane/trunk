Trunk is an early prototype of a tool for learning and practicing languages. It
is inspired by [Learning With Texts](https://learningwithtexts.com/).

⚠️ Trunk is currently under development and is not recommended for personal use.
With that said, it currently works as so:

1. Install and setup.
2. Find and create an article to practice reading (preferrably something
   short!).
3. Read the article while marking the familiarity of works and adding translations.


### Development

``` sh
npm install 
npm run dev
electron .
```

In emacs, `cider-jack-in-cljs` -> boot the dev server to enable compilation of the `main` build.
