* Building the application
** Icons
- Icons must be in =*.icns= format.
- You can convert a =.png= to =.icns= using Preview, provided it is exactly =512px x 512px= (and 300dpi).
** Issues with native dependencies
- using sqlite3 (through better-sqlite3) comes with some challenges regarding the need to rebuild the dependencies between different versions of node.

** Packaging / Distribution instructions

Last updated: [2021-10-28 Thu]

*** Steps to do a release

1. Update the version in your project's package.json file (e.g. 1.2.3)
 2. Commit that change (git commit -am v1.2.3)
 3. Tag your commit (git tag v1.2.3). Make sure your tag name's format is v*.*.*. Your workflow will use this tag to detect when to create a release
 4. Push your changes to GitHub (git push && git push --tags)

If you need to overwrite an existing release in Github, you'll need to:

1. Delete the release if it is not a draft
2. If it is a draft, delete all the uploaded assets.
3. make your commits, squash, and amend to the previous commit.
4. delete the tag that you are replacing.
5. Add the tag to the commit you ammended.
6. Force push the branch *and* the tags: =git push -f && git push --tags -f=


*** Notes

We use electron-builder to build Trunk on CI. See the
=.github/workflows/build.yml=. Please note that the CI process will only release
(and succeed) when you push a tag that *does not yet have draft releases to it*.
This is a [[https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/4940][bug]].

If you are trying to get upload artifacts into a release and the build is
failing, youi may need to manually [[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/777278/125193935-50c03680-e24f-11eb-99e5-c976eafda0bd.png][remove release uploads]] of your draft tag.
