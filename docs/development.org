* Building the application
** Icons
- Icons must be in =*.icns= format.
- You can convert a =.png= to =.icns= using Preview, provided it is exactly =512px x 512px= (and 300dpi).
** Issues with native dependencies
- using sqlite3 (through better-sqlite3) comes with some challenges regarding the need to rebuild the dependencies between different versions of node.
- Read [[https://github.com/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3/issues/545#issuecomment-824887942][this comment for more information]].

** Packaging / Distribution instructions

Last updated: [2021-10-23 Sat]
*** Steps to do a release
1. Push your code and get it ready for release. Once that's done...
2. Bump the =version= in package.json (example: 0.0.3)
3. Commit
4. Create a tag, and name it the same as the package.json version (example: =v.0.0.3=)
5. push the commit + the tag.
*** Notes

We use electron-builder to build Trunk on CI. See the
=.github/workflows/build.yml=. Please note that the CI process will only release
(and succeed) when you push a tag that *does not yet have draft releases to it*.
This is a [[https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/4940][bug]].

If you are trying to get upload artifacts into a release and the build is
failing, youi may need to manually [[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/777278/125193935-50c03680-e24f-11eb-99e5-c976eafda0bd.png][remove release uploads]] of your draft tag.
